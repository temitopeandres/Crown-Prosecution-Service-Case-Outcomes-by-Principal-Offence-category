# About the dataset
The dataset is twenty-four-month period of Crown Prosecution Service Case Outcomes by Principal Offence Category from the data.gov.uk website (link: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/89d0aef9-e2f9-4d1a-b779-5a33707c5f2c/crown-prosecution-service-case-outcomes-by-principal-offence-category-data). Dataset has 53 columns and 2150 data points.
# About the task
Using the data analytics tools and techniques learnt, apply different techniques related to descriptive and predictive analytics on the integrated dataset. 
Develop a prediction model using one linear regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique. 
The task deliverables will consist of the following: 
A report containing:
a. Definition of, at least, two different hypotheses based on the current dataset; 
b. Explanation and justification for any cleaning/integration technique used in the dataset; 
c. Analysis and interpretation of results using descriptive analytics; 
d. Implementation of a prediction model using one linear regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique; 
e. Critical review of the data analytics tools and techniques used. Analyse the effectiveness of the techniques used, discuss alternative solutions and compare strengths and weaknesses between them; 
f. Critical review of the visualisation tools used. Analyse the effectiveness of the visualisation tools used, discuss alternative solutions and compare strengths and weaknesses between them.
# Result
Data source and scenarios have been discussed in the report. Hypotheses have been presented, which support statistical results and analysis. Data is loaded using relevant libraries. Data pre-processing such as file merging, cleaning, sorting and others have been implemented along with some relevant discussion on data pre-processing impact and exploratory analysis. Some statistical analytics are presented with supporting results and data. Descriptive interpretations of the results are discussed in the report with some basic supporting results and plots. Different exploratory findings on crime such as type-wise, and region-wise are presented with corresponding results, plots and patterns along with covariance and correlation. The report has also presented the crime trend. Regression, classification and clustering models are presented with the prediction results and plots. Some prediction interpretations have been discussed. Critical review of the data analytics and visualisation are discussed in different places within the report which has the scope for improvement based on the critical analytics such as comparative analysis among the different models, and pattern analysis.
